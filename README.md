Managed to do EDA and find out the user retention for the company to see the monthly retention until three following months.

- Tools : SQL in BiqQuery and Google Sheets
- Check out my query [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=1072889830804:e1c2f3c2c8194a669cdfdbdd7ec7643b)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### 1. Monthly Orders and Users
Get the total users who completed the order and total orders per month (Jan 2019-Apr 2022)
 ``` sql
 SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC(DATE(created_at),month) as month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as total_user,
    COUNT(order_id) as total_order
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.orders`
  WHERE DATE(created_at) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2022-04-30'
  AND status = 'Complete'
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 1
  ```
 **Table results:**

### 2. Average Order Value (AOV) and Distinct User
Get average order value and total number of unique users, grouped by month  (Jan 2019-Apr 2022)

ROUND(SUM(sale_price)/ COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id),2) AS average_order_value
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items` AS oi
INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.orders` AS o
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE DATE(oi.created_at) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2022-04-30'
AND oi.status = 'Complete'
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year
```

FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users` 
WHERE DATE(created_at) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2022-04-30'

              FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users`)
UNION ALL
SELECT
first_name,
last_name,
gender,
MAX(age) OVER(PARTITION BY gender) AS oldest_age
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users` 
WHERE DATE(created_at) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2022-04-30'
